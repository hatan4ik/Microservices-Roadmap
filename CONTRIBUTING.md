# Contributing

PRs are welcome. Keep changes:
- educational (clear, minimal, runnable)
- vendor-neutral unless clearly labeled
- focused on patterns and trade-offs

## Docs standards

- Keep chapters decision-oriented: **why**, **when**, **trade-offs**, **pitfalls**, **hands-on**.
- Tie concepts to repo artifacts (paths, commands, manifests) where possible.
- Use the chapter template for new docs: `docs/_template.md`
- Prefer short sections and scannable bullets over long essays.

If adding tools, include:
- what problem it solves
- operational cost
- a smallest-possible example
