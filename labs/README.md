# Labs

Hands-on labs for the repo. Labs are designed to be short and runnable without extra setup beyond Docker.

## Labs index

1. [Lab 01 — Run the reference system locally](01-local-run.md)

## Notes

- Run labs from the repo root unless the lab says otherwise.
- If you get stuck, check the troubleshooting section in each lab and verify ports are free (`8080`, `50051`, `5432`, `9092`).
