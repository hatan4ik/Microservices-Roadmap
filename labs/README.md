# Labs

Hands-on labs for the repo. Labs are designed to be short and runnable without extra setup beyond Docker.

## Labs index

1. [Lab 01 — Run the reference system locally](01-local-run.md)
2. [Lab 02 — Deploy to Kubernetes locally](02-k8s-local.md)
3. [Lab 03 — Kubernetes Troubleshooting Challenge](03-k8s-troubleshooting.md)

## Notes

- Run labs from the repo root unless the lab says otherwise.
- If you get stuck, check the troubleshooting section in each lab and verify ports are free (`8080`, `50051`, `5432`, `9092`).
